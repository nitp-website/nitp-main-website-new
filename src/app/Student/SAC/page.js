Various cultural activities and indoor games are conducted in the SAC. This enormous building has numerous rooms each of which is dedicated to activities related to sports and extra-curricular activities. Student offices for the same are also hosted in the SAC. Also, many open spaces have been specifically designed in the SAC to promote community interaction. A huge stadium adjoins the SAC in which football and cricket matches are held.
