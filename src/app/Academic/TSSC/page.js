      A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed between Telecom Sector Skill Council and National Institute of Technology Patna for setting up a Centre of Excellence (CoE) to create a facility for practical training on the domain of Information and Communications Technology on 22nd January, 2021. Skill development training is being imparted by the CoE to enhance the employability of aspiring students on the cutting-edge technologies in the domain of Information and Communications Technology including Technical, Services and allied fields. The CoE will provide training on the base line courses and also on the advance courses like IOT, 5G and beyond, cyber security and robotics etc. Almost 190 students have been trained on different job roles by this centre. A state-of-art laboratory on internet of things (IOT) is being developed. Hopefully the lab will be ready shortly where training/research will be conducted on IOT/5G technologies.

      Director, NIT Patna, Prof. P. K. Jain, addressing the event, promised that NITP will encourage research activities in different fields, including electronics, communication, material science, information technology, and remote sensing, by the needs of the ISRO. If any institute in eastern India requires experimental help, our facility would be available. The funding is available not just for research initiatives, but also for undergraduate, postgraduate, Ph.D., and teaching faculty.

      The short-term projects will be for NITP and other institutes' B. Tech and M. Tech students. The center will also provide Ph.D. scholars and faculty members with long-term research and development projects. The projects can be individual projects or projects in collaboration with another institute. The projects will be scrutinized twice, first by the NITP and subsequently by the ISRO.For website visit : <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/isroracs/home" target="_blank" className='text-blue-600'> ISRO RAC</a>
