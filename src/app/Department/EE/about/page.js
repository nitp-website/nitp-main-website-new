                <p className="text-justify">The Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 1945 under Patna University with an intake of 20 students leading to Bachelor of Science (Engineering) degree of four-year duration. The four-year course was later changed to five-year integrated course in 1960 with an intake of 30 students and it continued up to 1972. Again, a four-year course was introduced in 1972 with the same intake capacity of 30 students. The intake was increased from 30 to 40 students in the sessions of 2005-06 and further in 2006-07 the intake capacity was increased to 60 students.</p>

                    <li>Power System Engineering and</li>
                    <li>Control System Engineering with an intake capacity of 10 in each specialization. The intake in the PG program was further increased to 18 students per specialization in 2004-05. The intake has been revised at the UG level in 2019-20 session to 110 and for PG, M. Tech. (Control Systems) â€“ 22, and M. Tech. (Power Systems)- 23 making a total of 45.</li>
