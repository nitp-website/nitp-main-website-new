            The Department of Physics was established in the year 1924 and since then
            has been functioning as an important unit of the institute. As of 
            now, the Department has nine faculty members who are actively involved 
            in both teaching and research and three supporting staffs including one Technical Assistant 
            for Labs. The Department of Materials Science and Engineering started in the year 2022. 
            The Department has started a new Dual degree program B.Tech-M.Tech
            in Material Science and Engineering from the session 2022-23. 
            There are 08 candidates enrolled in dual degree program in the session 2022-23 and 09 candidates 
            enrolled in the session 2023-24 and 10 candidates enrolled in the session 2024-25. 
            In the year of 2024-25 the department has been merged with Physics department 
            and thereafter new department has started and named as “Applied Physics and Materials Engineering”. 
            The Department is mentored by Prof. K.L.Chopra, Ex-Director, IIT Kharagpur.
