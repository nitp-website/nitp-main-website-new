Tech program during the era of Bihar College of Engineering (BCE) which is well-known since 1924 as the sixth oldest Engineering College in India. In 1978, M. Tech Program was started with specializations in &quot;Thermal Turbo Machinery&quot; and &quot;Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heat Transfer&quot;. The Bihar College of Engineering was converted to National Institute of Technology Patna in 2004. </p>
